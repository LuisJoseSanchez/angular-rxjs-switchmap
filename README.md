# RxJs switchMap operator example in Angular project

The aim of this project is to test `switchMap` operator. I follow the steps according the tutorial ["Deep Dive Into The RxJs switchMap Operator - How Does it Work? A Less Well-Known Use Case (selector functions)"](http://blog.angular-university.io/rxjs-switchmap-operator/) in [Angular University](https://angular-university.io/).
